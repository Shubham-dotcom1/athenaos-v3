Harmanpreet Kaur's 171* against Australia in the 2018 ICC Women's World Cup semi-final is the defining case study for AthenaOS.
In that innings, Harmanpreet faced a collapsing team (India had lost wickets at regular intervals) and responded with an extraordinary display of controlled aggression.
AthenaOS analysis of that innings would show:
- Pressure Index peaked at 0.85+ in the middle overs
- E(t) scores consistently above 80 during her assault
- Resilience score: 94/100 — almost no variance in performance despite escalating pressure
- Clutch Rating: Elite Clutch — SR of 191 with 20 fours and 7 sixes
- Emotional Profile: On Fire — sustained peak emotion state for 115 balls
- Momentum shift: India's momentum went from -0.7 to +0.9 within 5 overs of her acceleration
This innings exemplifies how AthenaOS can identify and quantify the psychological turning point of a match.

The Women's Premier League (WPL) launched in 2023 is India's premier women's T20 franchise tournament.
Teams: Mumbai Indians Women, Delhi Capitals Women, Royal Challengers Bangalore Women, UP Warriorz, Gujarat Giants.
AthenaOS was built specifically for the WPL context — to help fans, coaches, and analysts understand the emotional narrative of women's cricket.
Key WPL emotional patterns observed:
- Death over pressure (overs 16-20) generates the highest E(t) scores
- Powerplay wickets have outsized psychological impact (pressure multiplier effect)
- Momentum shifts in WPL matches are more frequent than in bilateral series
- Harmanpreet Kaur (MI-W captain) consistently shows Elite Clutch ratings in pressure situations
The WPL represents a new era for women's cricket in India, and AthenaOS aims to give it the analytical depth it deserves.

Momentum in AthenaOS is calculated as a weighted average of the last 12 balls' outcomes.
Formula: weighted_sum / total_weight where recent balls have higher weights (1 to 12).
Ball score = runs/6 - (1 if wicket else 0)
Momentum range: -1.0 (complete bowling dominance) to +1.0 (complete batting dominance)
Momentum shift is detected when: sign changes AND magnitude > 0.4
Psychological research shows momentum in cricket is real — teams that score 15+ in an over gain a psychological edge that affects the next 3 overs.
In women's cricket, momentum shifts tend to be more decisive — once a team gains momentum, they hold it longer on average.

AthenaOS is built on the principles of Affective Computing, pioneered by Rosalind Picard at MIT Media Lab (1997).
Affective Computing is the study and development of systems that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human emotions.
In sports analytics, affective computing enables:
- Quantification of psychological states from observable data (commentary, events)
- Real-time emotional tracking without biometric sensors
- Narrative generation that captures the human story behind statistics
AthenaOS applies affective computing to cricket by treating ball-by-ball commentary as an emotional signal stream.
The E(t) formula is our implementation of Picard's affect recognition framework adapted for cricket's unique emotional vocabulary.
Key insight: Cricket commentary is rich in emotional language — words like "magnificent", "disaster", "heartbreak" carry precise emotional valence that VADER (with cricket-specific lexicon) can quantify.
